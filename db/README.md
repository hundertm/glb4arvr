# HTML Templates for 3D Models

This repository contains a collection of templates for building immersive augmented reality (AR) experiences using popular frameworks.

## db Subfolder

The `/db` subfolder contains a set of templates for creating AR experiences with the following technologies:

### 1. A-Frame

A-Frame is an open-source framework that uses HTML and JavaScript to build AR experiences. The templates in this subfolder provide a starting point for creating A-Frame scenes, including basic entity setup, camera configuration, and lighting.

### 2. AR.js

AR.js is a popular JavaScript library for building AR experiences that run in the browser. The templates in this subfolder demonstrate how to use AR.js to create marker-based AR experiences, including setting up the AR.js scene, loading markers, and handling user interactions.

### 3. Geolocated AR

Geolocated AR experiences use the device's location and camera to superimpose virtual objects onto real-world locations. The templates in this subfolder provide examples of how to create geolocated AR experiences using popular libraries and frameworks.

## Getting Started

To use these templates, simply clone this repository and navigate to the `/db` subfolder. Choose the template that best suits your needs, and start building your AR experience.
